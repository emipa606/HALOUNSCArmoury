# You need a weapon? Right this way!


My goal is to add new weapons from the Halo Universe to Rimworld in a vanilla friendly way, meaning they fit artwise, lore-wise and value wise perfectly into Rimworld, as if they always have been part of it.

**"Rimworld: UNSC Armoury"** adds some of the most iconic UNSC weapons as well as the cool combat helmet from Halo 3 to Rimworld. All weapons have been slightly redesigned to feel more modern, yet keep the core Halo aesthetic.

This mod is lightweight, it has no extra code and can be removed anytime.

Q: Do I need a new save for this?
A: No.

Q: Do they spawn on enemies?
A: Yes.

Q: Can they be crafted?
A: Yes.

Q: Do they have their Halo sounds?

A: Make sure you have Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Lasers installed!
