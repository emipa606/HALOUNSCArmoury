[h1]You need a weapon? Right this way![/h1]

My goal is to add new weapons from the Halo Universe to Rimworld in a vanilla friendly way, meaning they fit artwise, lore-wise and value wise perfectly into Rimworld, as if they always have been part of it.

[b]"Rimworld: UNSC Armoury"[/b] adds some of the most iconic UNSC weapons as well as the cool combat helmet from Halo 3 to Rimworld. All weapons have been slightly redesigned to feel more modern, yet keep the core Halo aesthetic.

This mod is lightweight, it has no extra code and can be removed anytime.

Q: Do I need a new save for this?
A: No.

Q: Do they spawn on enemies?
A: Yes.

Q: Can they be crafted?
A: Yes.

Q: Do they have their Halo sounds?
A: No, they use the vanilla Rimworld sounds to better fit the game. A patch that adds the Halo sounds is in the works right now and can be added later without any problems!

Q: I cant find the spartan laser?
A: Make sure you have Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Lasers installed!

The concepts of these weapons, as well as their sounds, are property of Bungie/343i. I do not claim these as my own!
